# How to Get a 5 on AP Precalculus

AP Precalc isn't that bad of a class, and the exam is relatively easy. Of the 4 units, only content from 3 of them is tested on the exam. It gives you a better algebra and trig foundation for AP Calculus and other advanced math courses.

If you want to get an A in your class and a 5 on the exam, you're in the right place.

This article is meant to be a fairly comprehensive guide that, if followed properly, will substantially increase your preparedness for the Advanced Placement Precalculus examination. However, I cannot guarantee any single result on your classwork and AP exam.
