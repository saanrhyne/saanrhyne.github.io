# How to Get a 5 on AP Precalculus

AP Precalc isn't that bad of a class, and the exam is relatively easy. Of the 4 units, only content from 3 of them is tested on the exam. It gives you a better algebra and trig foundation for AP Calculus and other advanced math courses.

If you want to get an A in your class and a 5 on the exam, you're in the right place.

This article is meant to be a fairly comprehensive guide that, if followed properly, will substantially increase your preparedness for the Advanced Placement Precalculus examination. However, I cannot guarantee any single result on your classwork and AP exam. Feel free to [contact me](https://saanrhyne.github.io/#:~:text=You%20can%20contact%20me%20via) if you have any questions, feedback, or want some more help with AP Precalc.

## General Tips
These tips are important for any math class, especially AP Precalc.

### Actually Pay Attention
I cannot emphasize this enough. Even when class seems boring and you're falling asleep, pay attention. It's a tip that seems so simple and not worth mentioning, but a good 50% of my class (myself included, sometimes) would be staring at our phones playing a video game or watching reels at any given time. The kids who did that would say "It's ok, I'll do the work at home," and then consistently fail our entrance tickets and tests. If you pay attention and are engaged in the class, you will do better. In addition, your teacher will like you more, giving you a better chance at getting a grade rounded up. (not that you'll need that with this guide)

### Do *All* The Practice Problems
If your teacher assigns optional practice problems, do them. Just taking 15 minutes to practice your skills in addition to your homework will help you tremendously. You can find great practice problems online (more on that later), or ask your teacher if they have additional resources. We would be assigned DeltaMath reviews before quizzes and tests, and my teacher would show us the data: the percentage you completed of the review and the percentage students got on the test were often remarkably similar. Doing lots of practice problems helps cement the knowledge in your mind.

> This might have been "doing too much", but I got a 100% on that logs test

### Remember the Formulas
You might think, "Oh, I'll just derive formulas on the test instead of memorizing them." While that does work (I did that for some of the trig identities), it's always better to know formulas off the top of your head. Make flashcards and quiz yourself, or just write down the formulas on a post-it note and read them over every day. Doing practice problems will also help you remember formulas better, as you're more comfortable using them.

## Understanding the Course & Exam
### Units of Study
This course is broken up into 4 units, one of which isn't even tested on the AP exam. The unit divisisions are pretty logical, and cover subjects that are relatively unrelated. You shouldn't have a problem with confusing formulas or concepts between units

**Unit 1:** Polynomial and Rational Functions - *30 to 40% of the exam*

**Unit 2:** Exponential and Logarithmic Functions - *27 to 40% of the exam*

**Unit 3:** Trigonometric and Polar Functions - *30 to 35% of the exam*

**Unit 4:** Functions Involving Parameters, Vectors, and Matrices - *Not assessed on the exam*

### Mathmatical Practices
AP Precalc focuses on three main skills that students practice throughout the year. You'll see these skills throughout all four units.

**Procedural and Symbolic Fluency:** Using algebra to manipulate and change functions, equations, and expressions. - *39 to 48% of the exam*

**Multiple Representations:** Translating information into different forms (ie. exponential to logarithmic). - *20 to 27% of the exam*

**Communication and Reasoning:** Describing mathmatical concepts in precise ways and justifying conclusions. - *32 to 39% of the exam*

### The Exam
The exam lasts 3 hours, which is more like 3.5 - 4 hours depending on your school's test day procedures. It is a hybrid exam, meaning there are both digital and written questions.

**Section 1:** 40 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)

Part A
- 28 questions
- 80 minutes
- 43.75% of your score
- No calculator

Part B
- 12 questions
- 40 minutes
- 18.75% of your score
- Graphing calculator

**10 Minute Break:**

Grab some chips or some water, and get ready for a whole lot of writing (how scary üò±).

**Section 2:** 4 Free Response Questions (FRQs)

Part A
- 2 questions
- 30 minutes
- 18.75% of your score
- Graphing calculator

Part B
- 2 questions
- 30 minutes
- 18.75% of your score
- No calculator

## Resources I Used
This is the list of the only resources I used in preparation for AP Precalc, and my review of them. This list is in no particular order.
