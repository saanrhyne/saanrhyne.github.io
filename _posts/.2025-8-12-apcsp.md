# How to Get a 5 on AP Computer Science Principles

AP CSP is often regarded as one of the easiest AP classes. Because of this, it is relatively harder to get a 5. The content of the class itself really is not that hard, and it's even easier if you have a background in programming or anything tech related. If you don't, no problem.

If you want to get an A in your class and a 5 on the exam, you're in the right place.

This article is meant to be a fairly comprehensive guide that, if followed properly, will substantially increase your preparedness for the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles examination. However, I cannot guarantee any single result on your classwork and AP exam. Feel free to [contact me](https://saanrhyne.com/#:~:text=You%20can%20contact%20me%20via) if you have any questions, feedback, or want some more help with AP CSP.

## Understanding the Course & Exam
Before you take the course and/or exam, it's important to know what you're diving into. The course is broken up into 5 "Big Ideas", which is just a term the College Board decided to use instead of Units.

### Units of Study
**Unit 1:** Creative Development - *10 to 13% of the exam*
- 1.1: Collaboration
- 1.2: Program Function & Purpose
- 1.3: Program Design & Development
- 1.4: Identifying & Correcting Errors

**Unit 2:** Data - *17 to 22% of the exam*
- 2.1: Binary Numbers
- 2.2: Data Compression
- 2.3: Extracting Information from Data
- 2.4: Using Programs with Data

**Unit 3:** Algorithms & Programming - *30 to 35% of the exam*
- 3.1: Variables & Assignments
- 3.2: Data Abstraction
- 3.3: Mathematical Expressions
- 3.4: Strings
- 3.5: Boolean Expressions
- 3.6: Conditionals
- 3.7: Nested Conditionals
- 3.8: Iteration
- 3.9: Developing Algorithms
- 3.10: Lists
- 3.11: Binary Search
- 3.12: Calling Procedures
- 3.13: Developing Procedures
- 3.14: Libraries
- 3.15: Random Values
- 3.16: Simulations
- 3.17: Algorithmic Efficiency
- 3.18: Undecidable Problems

**Unit 4:** Computer Systems & Networks - *11 - 15% of the exam*
- 4.1: The Internet
- 4.2: Fault Tolerance
- 4.3: Parallel & Distributed Computing

**Unit 5:** Impact of Computing - *21 - 26% of the exam*
- 5.1: Beneficial and Harmful Effects
- 5.2: Digital Divide
- 5.3: Computing Bias
- 5.4: Crowdsourcing
- 5.5: Legal & Ethical Concerns
- 5.6: Safe Computing

As you can see, Unit 3 is definetly the biggest and most content-heavy unit. It focuses on programming, so if you already know a programming language (especially if its the one your class is in), it won't be too bad. It only covers basic concepts, so even those without programming experience should do fine if they pay attention.

### The Exam
The exam lasts 3 hours, which is more like 3.5 - 4 hours depending on your school's test day procedures. The exam has a multiple choice section and a written section. Your responses to the written section are based on the [Create Performance Task](/#the-create-performance-task), which is a program you create in class.

**Section 1:** 70 Multiple Choice Questions
- 70 questions
- 120 minutes
- 70% of your score
- 57 single-select
- 5 single-select with a passage
- 8 multiple-select

This gives you ~1.5 minutes per question. I had enough time to complete each question and double check each one twice, so timing shouldn't be a problem. If you spend more than 2 minutes on a question, flag it and move on.

**10 minute break**

Grab some chips or some water, and get ready to write about your [Create Performance Task](/#the-create-performance-task).

**Section 2:** Create Performance Task

Create Performance Task
- All components made in class
- 10% of your score
- Program code
- Program video
- Personalized Project Reference

Written Responses
- 2 questions
- 4 prompts
- 60 minutes
- 20% of your score
- Questions are based on your CPT
- You can use your Personalized Project Reference

This gives you 15 minutes per writing prompt. This should be more than enough time. If you find yourself spending over 20 minutes on a question, flag it and move on. Remember that it is better to write something and have it be completely wrong than to write nothing - you can't lose points, only gain them.
