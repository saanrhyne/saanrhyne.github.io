# Rev/Malware - Colin
*i found a suspicious program on my computer. apparently its NOT malware? i want to you help me check this out, can you help me out?*

## Initial Thoughts
We are given `malw`, which is a .so file. The computer says to check out the malware, but then says its not malware. Whenever I suspect something is malware, I like to upload it into [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload).

## Methodology
When I upload it into Virus Total, it seems to be legit. This confirms what the description said, but I felt there was something more to be found.

I decided to look through each tab, and `Ctrl+F` for "BCACTF". On the details tab, under Names (Names with which this file has been submitted or seen), we find our flag
![Virus Total](/assets/img/malware2.png)


## Solution
The flag is `bcactf{wtf_fake_malware_thx_virustotal}`. This was a pretty easy challenge, but might be difficult for those who aren't familiar with Virus Total or use other malware detector programs.
