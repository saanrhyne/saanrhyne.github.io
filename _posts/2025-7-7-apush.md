# How to Get a 5 on AP US History

I took APUSH my freshman year, and it was the first AP exam I took. I was pretty nervous before my first day of class, but by the time May 9th rolled around, I was confident that I was going to do great on the exam. I could complete the multiple choice section in 15 minutes with 90%+ accuracy, and I'd learned how to effectively answer all of the writing questions.

If you're in the same scenario that I was in the beginning of the year, and want to crush it on the APUSH exam, you're in the right place. Here's how I got an A+ in the class and a 5 on the exam, broken down step-by-step.

## General Tips
These tips can apply to any class, but are especially important for APUSH

### Actually Pay Attention
Yes. Even when class seems boring and you're falling asleep (I had it bright and early at 7:30am), pay attention. It's a tip that seems so simple and not worth mentioning, but you would be surprised how many people I saw scrolling on their phones or falling asleep just days before unit exams or our midterm.

## Resources I Used

## My Study Plan
I studied for 50+ hours for the APUSH exam, which was probably overkill. However, it paid off. Here is my exact study schedule, broken down into NUMBER sessions, each between 1-2 hours.

### Overall Breakdown
I brokedown the hours I spent dedicated to each unit relative to how well I understood it and how much it was tested on the exam. I spent roughly 1.5 hours on Unit 1, but spent 6 hours on Unit 3.

### One Hour Sessions (NUMBER):
1. Unit 1: 30 minutes of AMSCO review, 30 minutes of Khan Academy MCQ
2. Unit 1: 30 minutes of AMSCO writing practice. Unit 2: 30 minutes of AMSCO review
3. Unit 2: 30 minutes of AMSCO review, 30 minutes of Khan Academy MCQ
4. Unit 2: 1 hour of AMSCO writing practice
5. Unit 3: 1 hour of AMSCO review
