# OSINT/Fat Donke Diss - MC Fat Monke
*ain't no fat donke tryin to spit bars on the fat monke*

## Initial Thoughts
We aren't given an attachment or any links with the challenge, which is odd.

## Methodology
First, I look up the challenge description.

I find this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWugaNwXjzI).

If you watch through the video, at [0:54](https://youtu.be/dWugaNwXjzI?si=_3Fd6N6S_Z33aeMp&t=54), you can see the flag.

## Solution
The flag is `DUCTF{I_HAVE_NOT_THOUGHT_UP_OF_A_FLAG_YET}`. This was a fairly easy OSINT challenge, but the fact that we weren't given an image or link explicitly made it slightly unique.
