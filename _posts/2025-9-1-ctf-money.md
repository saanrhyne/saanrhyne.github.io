# I won $65.35 from a CTF
Over the summer, my CTF team [Sytnax Error](https://ctftime.org/team/365677) did about one CTF a week. We didn't place super well in any of them, but we still had tons of fun, learned a lot, and I even made some money.

I entered my [writeup](/posts/grannie-writeup) for the Love GranniE challenge from [DUCTF](https://downunderctf.com/) into their "Most Entertaining Writeup" challenge. I always enter in writeup challenges from CTFs, just because there's a small chance I could win.

About a week after the writeup contest closed, I got an email from the president of Down Under CTF.

After a little bit of discussion, he sent me the money, and my writeup was shared in the Down Under CTF Discord server.

Thank you to the organizers of Down Under CTF for a great competition, and shoutout to my team members on Sytnax Error for helping me learn and reach this far.
