# Just Some Avocado (302pts)

*just an innocent little avocado!*

## Initial Thoughts
We are given an image file, `avocado.jpg`. Because it is a forensics challenge, the first thing to check is stegonography.

## Methodology

I uploaded the image into Aperi'solve, and foremost found a zip file.

Unfortunately, the zip file requires a password.

Using [zip-password-finder](https://github.com/agourlay/zip-password-finder) and [rockyou](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt), we find the password `impassive3428`.

Unzipping the file shows `staticnoise.wav` and `justsomezip.zip`.

Unfortunately, `justsomezip.zip` is password protected. However, it does seem to contain the flag.

This means that `staticnoise.wav` must have the password hidden somehow. The audio is, just as it says, static noise. This means that it's probably not morse code or garbled text in the audio file itself.

The next thing to check is spectograms. Sometimes audio files have hidden pictures/text "drawn" on the wavelengths that are revealed when you view the spectogram.

I upload staticnoise.wav into [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and switch it to spectogram view.

This reveals a hidden message of `d41v3ron`. Using that as the password for `justsomezip.zip` works.

Finally, we find `flag.txt`.

## Solution

The flag is `scriptCTF{1_l0ve_d41_v3r0n}`. This was a relatively simple forensics challenge that combined numerous basic techniques, and  I had fun.
