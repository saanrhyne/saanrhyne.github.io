# AP Guides

The College Board publishes Course and Exam Descriptions for each AP course. These documents are normally around 200 pages, with the shortest one being 53 pages for AP 2-D Art and Design, AP 3-D Art and Design, and AP Drawing. The longest one is for AP United States History, coming in at a whopping 560 pages!

These documents are verbose, contain more detail than students need, and take forever to load. As a result, I have decided to start condensing some of them down for readability and to offer students a simpler way to understand the courses they are taking.

This list will be updated as I create more guides, and I will share the links to completed, in progress, and coming soon guides. I will prioritize doing this for courses I am taking or would like to take, but feel free to shoot me an email at [contact@saanrhyne.com](mailto:contact@saanrhyne.com) to request specific guides or for advice with your classes.

Click the image above each course name to open their respective documents.
