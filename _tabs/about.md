Howdy! My name is Saan Rhyne, and I am a high school sophomore from the great state of Maryland.

I created this website to share my ideas, experiences, and writeups with others. This website will mainly focus on cyber-related topics, and there may be some posts generally relating to high school.

* I am interested in cybersecurity and public policy, and hope to dual major in those fields in college
* I would like to work for the government, or in another role where I can serve my fellow Americans
* I am involved in student council on the county and state level
* I compete in CyberPatriot and CTF competitions, and was a CyberPatriot National Finalist in the 2024-25 season
* I train in Seido karate, where I am a brown belt, and I have a junior black belt in Jiu Jitsu

You can contact me via email at `srhyne0516@gmail.com` if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, etc. I hope you enjoy reading my blog, and that you learn something from it.
