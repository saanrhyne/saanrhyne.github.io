Howdy! My name is Saan Rhyne, and I am a high school sophomore from the great state of Maryland with a passion for cybersecurity and public policy.

I created this website to share my ideas, experiences, and writeups with others. This website will mainly focus on cyber-related topics, and there may be some posts generally relating to high school.

* I hope to dual major in cybersecurity and public policy in college
* I would like to serve my fellow Americans through a role in government or service
* I am involved in student leadership and advocacy on the county and state level
* I compete in CyberPatriot and CTF competitions, and was a CyberPatriot National Finalist in the 2024-25 season
* I train in Seido karate, where I am a brown belt, and hold a junior black belt in Jiu Jitsu
* I use flashcards to study for everything, from Cisco to AP exams, and they can all be found on [Knowt](https://knowt.com/u/sans_).

*Authenticity Guarantee:* Any content shared on this webpage is my own and not AI-generated unless explicity marked as such ([example](https://saanrhyne.com/posts/success-writeup/#:~:text=There%20was%20some%20vibe)). While artificial intelligence can be a useful tool, I do not believe it should replace authentic human writing and opinion. I do not post writeups for CTF challenges I solved exclusively using generative AI for this reason.

Feel free to contact me via email at [contact@saanrhyne.com](mailto:contact@saanrhyne.com) if you want to discuss cybersecurity, public policy, high school, or anything else. I hope you enjoy reading my blog, and that you learn something from it. Have a great day!
