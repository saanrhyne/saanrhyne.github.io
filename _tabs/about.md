Howdy! My name is Saan Rhyne, and I am a high school sophomore from the great state of Maryland with a passion for cybersecurity and public policy.

I created this website to share my ideas, experiences, and writeups with others. This website will mainly focus on cyber-related topics, and there may be some posts generally relating to high school.

* I hope to dual major in cybersecurity and public policy in college
* I would like to serve my fellow Americans through a role in government or service
* I am involved in student leadership and advocacy on the county and state level
* I compete in CyberPatriot and CTF competitions, and was a CyberPatriot National Finalist in the 2024-25 season
* I train in Seido karate, where I am a brown belt, and hold a junior black belt in Jiu Jitsu

One of my guiding principles, taken from the muscial *Hamilton*, is:

> "God help and forgive me, I wanna build something that's gonna outlive me."

Feel free to contact me via email at `srhyne0516@gmail.com` if you want to discuss cybersecurity, public policy, high school, or anything related to me or this website. I hope you enjoy reading my blog, and that you learn something from it. Have a great day!
